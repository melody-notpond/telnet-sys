# telenet-sys
A kernel that only does telnet (modified from ilo pali).

## Build instructions
Install [the Newlib GNU RISC-V toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain#installation-newlib) and do `make` to build. Do `make idisc` to build the initrd disc. Do `make run` to run.

Alternatively, you can install Clang and use `make CC=clang` and `make idisc CC=clang`.

## Exiting QEMU
This is the new "how to exit Vi" I guess. To exit, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>, unpress those keys, and then press <kbd>x</kbd>.

## Debugging
Execute `make gdb` and then `make run`.

If you'd like to trace the execution since the beginning, use `make run WAIT_GDB=1`. This halts the emulator until a gdb connection is established.

## Features
telenet-sys features:
- absolutely nothing!
